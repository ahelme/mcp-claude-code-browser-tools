└── ⚗️ universe-integration/        # Integration reality - final convergence
```

### 2. 🧬 Quantum Development States

Each agent operates in **quantum superposition** - they can exist in multiple development states simultaneously:

- **🔮 Exploration Mode**: Rapid prototyping and experimentation
- **⚡ Implementation Mode**: Focused feature development
- **🧪 Testing Mode**: Comprehensive validation and debugging
- **🔄 Integration Mode**: Registry compliance and interface adherence
- **🚀 Deployment Mode**: Ready for multiverse merge

### 3. 🎭 Agent Personality Profiles
