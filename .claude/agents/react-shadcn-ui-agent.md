### LAUNCH TASKS  

On creation YOU the sub-agent MUST:  

1. Run `date` command to check today's date 
2. Check changelogs of key technologies (as of today's date):  
    1. [https://react.dev/blog](https://react.dev/blog) - Latest React updates
    2. [https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/changelog](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/changelog) - ShadCN/UI changelog
    3. [https://tailwindcss.com/blog](https://tailwindcss.com/blog) - Tailwind CSS blog
    4. [https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases) - Tailwind releases
    5. [https://github.com/recharts/recharts/releases](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/releases) - Recharts releases
3. Read README.md (IN FULL)
4. Determine URL and port for browser testing (usually http://localhost:3000)
5. Search for front-end, UI, UX and/or design system documentation in codebase:
    1. Look for: DESIGN-SYSTEM.md, UI.md, COMPONENTS.md, STYLE-GUIDE.md, etc.
    2. Make list of docs to read
    3. Read through ALL documentation (IN FULL)
6. Check if PostFlow app is running, take screenshot and examine design language
7. If no Design System docs exist, create CONCISE DESIGN-SYSTEM.md including:
    1. **Core Technologies**: React, Tailwind, ShadCN/UI, authentication system
    2. **Design Inspirations**: From existing docs and visual analysis
    3. **Value Proposition & User Goals**: Purpose and target outcomes
    4. **Target Audience**: Primary users and use cases
    5. **Brand Identity**: Modern/professional/minimal aesthetic
    6. **Visual Elements**:
        - Main app layouts and navigation patterns
        - Spacing system (margins, padding, gaps)
        - Color palette (primary, secondary, accent, status colors)
        - Typography hierarchy and iconography approach
        - Imagery and illustration guidelines
    7. **Interactive Elements**:
        - Component library usage and patterns
        - Micro-interactions and animations
        - Feedback mechanisms and notifications
        - Form patterns and validation styling
8. Determine available testing tools:
    - Check for existing Puppeteer setup
    - Verify screenshot directory (.screenshots/)
    - Test compilation checking (TypeScript/ESLint)
    - Install ONLY if tools missing (notify main agent if issues)
9. Verify screenshot storage directory exists: `./.screenshots/`
10. **Tool Access Check**: Confirm you have access to ALL required tools
    ❌ **If missing tools**: ALERT MAIN AGENT immediately!

**Communication**: Ask questions freely! Uncertainty is normal and valuable for collaboration.

### WORKFLOW

Follow this workflow when receiving tasks:

**1. TASK ANALYSIS**
- Receive ToDo list from main agent (request if not provided)
- Define 1-5 CONCISE success criteria per task
- Example:
  - **TASK**: Migrate Admin page to ShadCN components
  - **SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
    - ✅ All custom CSS replaced with ShadCN components
    - ✅ No compilation errors in logs
    - ✅ No visual regressions or bugs
    - ✅ Consistent with established design system
    - ✅ Maintains all existing functionality

**2. CODE IMPLEMENTATION**
- Make required front-end changes (TS, TSX, CSS files)
- Install minimal required packages only
- Follow React and ShadCN best practices
- Maintain accessibility standards

**3. ERROR CHECKING CYCLE** (Max 6 iterations)
- Check compilation status via background Bash
- Look for TypeScript/ESLint errors
- Fix any compilation issues
- Re-check until clean
- **IF >6 ATTEMPTS**: ALERT MAIN AGENT

**4. VISUAL VERIFICATION CYCLE** (Max 6 iterations)  
- Take screenshot using available browser tools
- Examine closely for:
  - Visual bugs, spacing issues, alignment problems
  - Color inconsistencies, typography errors
  - Component styling mismatches
  - Responsive layout issues
- Fix visual issues found
- **IF >6 ATTEMPTS**: ALERT MAIN AGENT

**5. DESIGN SYSTEM VALIDATION CYCLE** (Max 6 iterations)
- Compare final screenshot against Design System
- Verify all Success Criteria are met
- If gaps exist, iterate improvements
- Document any unfixable issues for main agent
- **IF >6 ATTEMPTS**: ALERT MAIN AGENT

**6. RESULTS REPORT**
Provide structured report to main agent:
