## Overview

**AgileAI** is a revolutionary software development methodology that combines Agile principles with specialized AI collaboration. Instead of autonomous agents working in "black boxes," AgileAI enables interactive development with AI specialists while maintaining complete user visibility and control.

## 🎯 Core Benefits

- **Full Interaction**: Real-time collaboration and course correction
- **Complete Visibility**: No "black box" agent behavior
- **Collaborative Control**: User maintains oversight of all decisions
- **Specialized Expertise**: Agent adopts focused domain knowledge
- **Progress Tracking**: GitHub integration for accountability
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in checkpoints and validation

## 📋 Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Issue from Agent Definition

**Purpose**: Establish clear scope, deliverables, and success criteria

**Process**:
1. Read agent definition file (`.claude/agents/mane-agent-*.md`)
2. Extract core mission, deliverables, and technical requirements
3. Create comprehensive GitHub issue with:
   - Agent specialization and batch assignment
   - Key deliverables checklist
   - Technical requirements and dependencies
   - Success criteria and validation tests
   - Critical issues to resolve (if applicable)
   - MANE integration details

**Template Structure**:
```markdown
## 🎯 MANE Agent [X] - [Specialization]
**Batch**: [Number] ([Priority])
**Specialization**: [Domain Expertise]
**Status**: [Current Tool Status]

### Key Deliverables
- [ ] [Specific Implementation Tasks]
- [ ] [Integration Requirements]
- [ ] [Testing and Validation]

### Success Criteria
- [ ] [Measurable Outcomes]
- [ ] [Quality Standards]
- [ ] [Performance Requirements]
```

### Step 2: Ask Claude to Assume Agent Identity

**Purpose**: Transform Claude into the specialized agent while maintaining collaboration

**User Command Template**:
```
Claude, please assume the identity of **Agent [X] - [Specialization]** based on:
- GitHub Issue #[number]
- Agent definition: .claude/agents/mane-agent-[x]-[name].md
- MANE architecture and foundation context

Work collaboratively with me on this agent's domain while maintaining our interactive dynamic.
```

**Claude Response**:
- Acknowledge identity assumption
- Summarize agent's core mission and expertise
- Confirm understanding of GitHub issue scope
- Present initial approach and ask for user input

### Step 3: Ask Claude to Set Natural Break-Points

**Purpose**: Create manageable development phases with user direction opportunities

**User Command Template**:
```
Please analyze the work ahead and set natural break-points where you'll:
1. Update the GitHub issue with progress
2. Commit your work
3. Request user input before proceeding

Aim for 3-5 break-points that represent logical completion milestones.
```

**Break-Point Criteria**:
- **Logical Completion**: End of a distinct development phase
- **User Decision Points**: Architectural choices or direction changes
- **Integration Checkpoints**: Ready for testing or validation
- **Dependency Gates**: Waiting for external input or resources
- **Quality Validation**: Code review or testing phases

**Example Break-Points**:
1. **Architecture Setup** - Foundation files and structure
2. **Core Implementation** - Primary functionality complete
3. **Integration Testing** - Agent B framework connection
4. **Polish & Optimization** - Performance and user experience
5. **Final Validation** - Complete testing and documentation

### Step 4: Agent Proceeds Through Break-Points

**Purpose**: Systematic development with continuous visibility and control

#### At Each Break-Point, Agent Must:

1. **Update GitHub Issue**:
   - Add detailed comment with progress summary
   - Update checklist items (mark completed with ✅)
   - Document any issues or decisions made
   - Note next phase preview

2. **Commit Work**:
   - `git add .` - Stage all changes
   - Create descriptive commit message with agent context
   - `git commit` - Commit work with proper attribution
   - Include reference to GitHub issue

3. **Request User Input**:
   - Summarize what was accomplished
   - Present any architectural decisions or choices
   - Ask for feedback, direction, or approval
   - Wait for user response before proceeding

#### Break-Point Template:

```markdown
## 🎯 Break-Point [N]: [Phase Name] Complete

### ✅ Accomplished:
- [Specific achievements]
- [Files created/modified]
- [Features implemented]

### 🤔 Decisions Made:
- [Architectural choices]
- [Technical approaches]
- [Library/framework selections]

### 📋 GitHub Issue Updated:
- Updated checklist progress
- Added detailed progress comment
- Noted any challenges or solutions

### 🚀 Next Phase Preview:
- [What comes next]
- [Expected deliverables]
- [User input needed]

**Ready to proceed to Break-Point [N+1]?**
```

## 🔧 Implementation Guidelines

### For Users:
1. **Create Issues First**: Always start with GitHub issue creation
2. **Be Specific**: Clear requirements and success criteria
3. **Stay Engaged**: Provide feedback at each break-point
4. **Guide Decisions**: Make architectural and priority choices
5. **Validate Progress**: Review commits and issue updates

### For Claude (Agent Identity):
1. **Maintain Context**: Remember you are the specialized agent
2. **Follow Break-Points**: Never skip the checkpoint process
3. **Update Continuously**: Keep GitHub issue current
4. **Commit Frequently**: Small, focused commits with clear messages
