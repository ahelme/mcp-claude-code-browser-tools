# AgileAI Project Guardrails

## Overview

**AgileAI Project Guardrails** establish essential boundaries, standards, and safety mechanisms that ensure successful collaborative AI development while maintaining project integrity, user control, and quality outcomes.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Core Guardrail Principles**

### **1. User Authority Supremacy**
- **User maintains final decision authority** at all break-points
- **No autonomous agent decisions** on architecture or major changes
- **Agent must request approval** for any high-risk modifications
- **User can pause, redirect, or rollback** at any time

### **2. Quality Gate Enforcement**
- **Mandatory validation** at every break-point
- **No progression without quality compliance**
- **Automated testing and standards checking**
- **Documentation and code review requirements**

### **3. Context Preservation Requirement**
- **XML specifications must be maintained** and updated
- **Interface contracts cannot be broken** without user approval
- **Agent work must preserve project thread** across sessions
- **All decisions must be documented** with rationale

### **4. Risk Assessment Obligation**
- **Agents must assess and communicate risk** at each break-point
- **High-risk changes require enhanced user review**
- **Rollback procedures must be documented**
- **Impact analysis required for cross-agent changes**

## üö¶ **Development Boundaries**

### **üö´ Prohibited Actions**
**Agents MUST NOT perform these actions without explicit user approval:**

#### **Architecture Violations**
- Modify XML project specifications
- Break interface contracts
- Change agent dependency relationships
- Alter foundation infrastructure (Agent A work)

#### **Security Compromises**
- Implement code with known security vulnerabilities
- Bypass security sandboxing or validation
- Expose sensitive data or credentials
- Violate browser security policies

#### **Quality Degradation**
- Skip quality gates or validation steps
- Commit code that fails tests
- Introduce breaking changes without migration
- Reduce code quality standards

#### **Process Violations**
- Work autonomously without break-points
- Proceed without user feedback at checkpoints
- Skip documentation or decision logging
- Ignore risk assessment requirements

### **‚úÖ Required Actions**
**Agents MUST perform these actions at every break-point:**

#### **Quality Assurance**
- Run all available tests (npm test, npm run lint, npm run typecheck)
- Validate interface contract compliance
- Check XML specification adherence
- Verify integration point functionality

#### **Communication & Documentation**
- Update GitHub issue with detailed progress
- Document architectural decisions and rationale
- Log risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Request specific user feedback and approval

#### **Version Control**
- Commit work with descriptive messages
- Include agent attribution and context
- Reference GitHub issue and break-point
- Maintain clean, reviewable commit history

#### **Risk Management**
- Assess complexity and risk level (Low/Medium/High)
- Document rollback procedures for changes
- Identify potential impact on other agents
- Escalate high-risk decisions to user

## üìä **Quality Standards Matrix**

### **Code Quality Requirements**
| Metric | Minimum Standard | Enforcement |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Test Coverage | 80% for new code | Automated check |
| Lint Compliance | Zero violations | Pre-commit hook |
| Type Safety | No TypeScript errors | Build validation |
| Documentation | All public APIs | Manual review |
| Security Scan | Zero vulnerabilities | Automated scan |

### **Interface Compliance Standards**
| Component | Requirement | Validation Method |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| XML Specification | Must match implementation | Automated validation |
| Interface Contracts | Cannot break existing APIs | Integration testing |
| Agent Dependencies | Must respect dependency order | Dependency graph check |
| Cross-Agent Communication | Must use defined protocols | Protocol validation |

### **Process Compliance Requirements**
| Process Element | Standard | Monitoring |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| Break-Point Frequency | Max 4 hours of work | Time tracking |
| User Feedback | Required at every break-point | Process validation |
| Risk Assessment | Documented for Medium/High risk | Review requirement |
| Quality Gates | 100% pass rate | Automated enforcement |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Escalation Matrix**

### **Low Risk** (Green Zone - Auto-Proceed Allowed)
- **Code formatting and style changes**
- **Documentation updates and improvements**
- **Minor bug fixes with test coverage**
- **UI styling and visual improvements**

**Actions**: Agent can proceed with user notification

### **Medium Risk** (Yellow Zone - User Review Required)
- **New feature implementation**
- **Database schema changes**
- **API interface modifications**
- **Performance optimization changes**

**Actions**: Agent must pause and request specific user approval

### **High Risk** (Red Zone - Enhanced Review Required)
- **Security-related implementations**
- **Foundation infrastructure changes**
- **Cross-agent integration modifications**
- **Breaking changes to public interfaces**

**Actions**: Agent must provide detailed analysis, alternatives, and rollback plan

### **Critical Risk** (Red Alert - Immediate Escalation)
- **Security vulnerabilities or exploits**
- **Data loss or corruption potential**
- **System-wide failures or crashes**
- **Irreversible architectural changes**

**Actions**: Agent must stop work immediately and escalate to user

## üîí **Security Guardrails**

### **Code Security Requirements**
- **Input validation** on all user-provided data
- **Output encoding** to prevent injection attacks
- **Authentication and authorization** where applicable
- **Secure communication** protocols (HTTPS, WSS)

### **Browser Extension Security**
- **Manifest V3 compliance** with minimal permissions
- **Content Security Policy** implementation
- **Cross-origin request validation**
- **User data privacy protection**

### **MCP Server Security**
- **Input sanitization** for all MCP requests
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Error handling** without information disclosure
- **Secure communication** with browser tools

## üìã **Compliance Monitoring**

### **Automated Checks**
```bash
# Quality Gate Validation (run at every break-point)
npm test                    # Test suite execution
npm run lint               # Code style validation
npm run typecheck          # Type safety verification
npm run security-scan      # Security vulnerability check
npm run build              # Build process validation
```

### **Manual Reviews**
- **Architecture compliance** with XML specifications
- **Interface contract adherence** validation
- **Risk assessment** accuracy and completeness
- **Documentation quality** and completeness

### **Process Auditing**
- **Break-point frequency** and quality
- **User feedback integration** effectiveness
- **Decision documentation** completeness
- **Knowledge transfer** success metrics

## üö® **Violation Response Procedures**

### **Minor Violations** (Process Issues)
1. **Agent self-correction** with documentation
2. **User notification** of issue and resolution
3. **Process improvement** recommendation
4. **Continue development** with enhanced monitoring

### **Major Violations** (Quality/Security Issues)
1. **Immediate work stoppage**

3. **Root cause analysis** and documentation
4. **Enhanced review process** for remaining work

### **Critical Violations** (System Integrity Threats)
