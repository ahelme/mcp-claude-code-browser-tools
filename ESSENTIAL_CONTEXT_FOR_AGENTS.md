# 🦁 Essential Context for MANE Agents
**Critical Information for All Browser Tools Agents**

---

## 🎯 **PRIMARY MISSION: Build Complete Chrome Extension from Scratch**

**IMPORTANT**: We are building a **brand new Chrome browser extension** from the ground up. We only have the UI design (`panel.html`) - everything else needs to be created!

### 🚀 **The Reality Check**

✅ **What We Actually Have:**
- **UI Design**: `chrome-extension-mvp/panel.html` - Beautiful responsive 4-panel layout (HTML/CSS only)
- **Backend Infrastructure**: MCP server + HTTP bridge working perfectly (port 3024)
- **Reference Implementation**: `chrome-extension-old/` - Shows communication patterns but broken

❌ **What We Need to Build from Scratch:**
- **Complete Chrome Extension**: manifest.json, service worker, content scripts
- **All 9 Browser Tools**: Every single tool needs to be implemented
- **Communication Layer**: WebSocket connection between extension and HTTP bridge
- **Security Systems**: Safe JavaScript execution, content sanitization
- **UI Integration**: Connect beautiful panel.html to working functionality

---

## 📁 **Critical Files & References**

### 🎨 **UI Design (DESIGN ONLY)**
- **`chrome-extension-mvp/panel.html`** - Our responsive UI design (HTML structure)
- **`chrome-extension-mvp/panel.css`** - Modern styling with aqua/magenta theme
- **Status**: 🎨 DESIGN COMPLETE - needs JavaScript functionality

### 🔧 **Reference Implementation (STUDY ONLY)**
- **`chrome-extension-old/`** - Original extension to study for patterns
- **Key files to understand**:
  - `chrome-extension-old/panel.js` - Communication patterns with HTTP bridge
  - `chrome-extension-old/background.js` - Service worker setup
  - `chrome-extension-old/manifest.json` - Extension configuration
  - `chrome-extension-old/content.js` - Content script patterns
- **Status**: ⚠️ REFERENCE ONLY - broken but shows working communication patterns

### 🖥️ **Backend Infrastructure (WORKING)**
- **`scripts/mcp-claude-code-browser-tools.mjs`** - MCP server (Claude Code integration)
- **`scripts/mcp-http-bridge.mjs`** - HTTP bridge (port 3024)
- **Communication Flow**: Claude Code → MCP Server → HTTP Bridge → [YOUR EXTENSION]
- **Status**: ✅ WORKING - waiting for Chrome extension to connect

---

- Safe log categorization and transmission

---

## 🚨 **Critical Guidelines for All Agents**

### ✅ **DO:**
- Study `chrome-extension-old/` for communication patterns ONLY
- Use the existing HTTP bridge communication (port 3024)
- Integrate with our beautiful UI in `chrome-extension-mvp/panel.html`
- Follow Chrome Extension Manifest V3 standards
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Test thoroughly with different websites and scenarios
- **Follow the batch protocol - wait for your batch dependencies**

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Copy broken functionality from the old extension
- Try to fix the old broken npm package
- Ignore batch dependencies (F→G,H,I→B,C,D,E)
- Create complex dependencies between tool agents
- Assume undocumented behavior - verify everything
- Skip security requirements (especially JavaScript execution)

### 🤔 **WHEN UNSURE:**
**ALWAYS come back to the user for clarification rather than making assumptions!**

If you encounter:
- Unclear requirements or specifications
- Complex security decisions
- Questions about batch dependencies
- UI/UX integration questions
- Communication protocol questions
- Chrome Extension development questions

**→ STOP and ask the user for guidance before proceeding!**

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

- **Complete Chrome Extension**: Installable, working, beautiful UI
- **All 9 Browser Tools**: Every tool implemented and tested
- **Secure Architecture**: Safe JavaScript execution, content protection
- **Professional Quality**: Error handling, user feedback, performance
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Self-contained solution
- **Perfect Claude Code Integration**: Seamless MCP tool usage
